memtroll -- malloc failures generator(TM)

memtroll uses LD_PRELOAD to load a modified version of `malloc' before
launch a program.  It runs the program different times forcing malloc
to fail after a specified number of calls.

The following command for example will iteratively check the first 100
malloc calls, executing "ls -l" 100 times and forcing malloc to fail
at different iterations:

./memtroll -f0 -t100 -- ls -l

It is also possible to specify a different log file where write
memtroll errors:

./memtroll -l log.txt -f0 -t100 -- ls -l
